# Digital Logic Circuits – Homework

This repository contains a homework assignment for a Digital Logic Circuits course.

## Overview
The work focuses on designing and analyzing basic logic circuits, including XOR implementations using different logic configurations such as AND-OR and NAND-NAND structures. The objective is to understand Boolean logic behavior and circuit simplification through practical implementation.

## Contents
- Logic circuit report (documentation)
- Logic circuit simulation files
- Truth table analysis

## Tools Used
- **MARS (MIPS Assembler and Runtime Simulator)**
- Logic circuit simulation software (.circ files)

## Notes
- This work is an academic homework assignment created for learning and practice purposes.
- The focus is on logic design and analysis rather than full system development.
